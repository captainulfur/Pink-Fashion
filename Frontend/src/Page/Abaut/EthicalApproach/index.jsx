        We spend months finding the best factories around the worldâ€”the same ones that produce your favorite designer labels.
        We visit them often and build strong personal relationships with the owners. Each factory is given a compliance audit to
        evaluate factors like fair wages, reasonable hours, and environment. Our goal? A score of 90 or above for every factory.
